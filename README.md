# Wwise-Unpacker

Unpack game audio Wwise files (pck, bnk)

To easily extract pck files, drag and drop them from explorer onto the `DRAG-DROP-PCK-FILES-ONTO-ME.bat`
script and they will automatically be extracted and shown in the output folder.

This forked version always exports mp3s, and includes a new DRAG-DROP-PCK-FILES-ONTO-ME.bat script.
